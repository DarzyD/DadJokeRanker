        <p>This website is meant as a final project for  
            CS 426: Scalable Web Services taught at UMass Amherst by the GOAT, Tim Richards.
            The frontend of this website is built using Svelte, a JavaScript framework that compiles to vanilla JavaScript.
            The backend of this website is built using Node.js and Express.js.
            And all of the data is stored in a MongoDB database.
            Hopefully you enjoy the website and the jokes!
