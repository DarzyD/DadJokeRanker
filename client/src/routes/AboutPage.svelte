        <p>This website is meant as a final project for  
            CS 426: Scalable Web Services taught at UMass Amherst by the GOAT, Tim Richards.
            The frontend of this website is built using Svelte, a JavaScript framework that compiles to vanilla JavaScript.
            The backend of this website is built using Node.js and Express.js.
            And all of the data is stored in a MongoDB database.
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to build this website because my first ever web side project was a random dad jokes frontend made with React. 
            I wanted to build a website that was similar to that one, but with a backend and a database.
            All the jokes are fetched from the <a href="https://icanhazdadjoke.com/api">icanhazdadjoke API</a>.
            Hopefully you enjoy the website and the jokes!
